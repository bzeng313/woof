Greetings CS194W Teaching Team and fellow project teammates! 
My name is Tim Sah and I am a senior majoring in Computer Science. Although my concentration is in AI, I am looking forward to expanding my knowledgebase and gaining full-stack experience via current coursework and learning from y'all throughout the rest of the quarter.
I cannot wait to get the ball rolling and start building something exciting!
